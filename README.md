### Overview

This project follows a component-based architecture to ensure better modularity and maintainability. Due to some API issues, dummy data was used to populate the components for demonstration purposes.

The following technologies and tools were utilized:

- Vue 3 – for building interactive user interfaces
- Bootstrap 5 – for responsive design and layout
- Pinia – state management
- Composition API – for more organized and flexible component logic
- Custom CSS – to tweak styles in the absence of complete design access

### Constraints

Dummy Data: Since there were API issues, the components use placeholder data for now.

Custom CSS and Design Changes: Some styling adjustments were made due to incomplete access to the Figma design.

## Job Requirement

This project was developed to meet the following requirements:

- Vue 3 Integration: Used component-based approach for better structure and maintainability.
- API Integration: Although the API could not be fully integrated due to issues, the components were prepared with dummy data to simulate functionality.


## Note:
The main requirement of the test task was to follow a component-based approach, which I prioritized throughout the development. There might be some missing functionality or design inconsistencies due to API CORS errors and data issues. However, since the primary objective was to implement a component-based structure, I believe this approach fulfills the purpose of the task.
